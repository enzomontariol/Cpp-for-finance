# CSV Parser

## Overview
The CSV Parser component is designed to read and parse CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files containing order data for the financial trading system. This component allows the system to import orders from external data sources.

## File Structure
- **csv_parser.hpp**: Header file with declarations
- **csv_parser.cpp**: Implementation file

## Expected Functionality
While the implementation is currently pending, this component is intended to support the following features:

1. **File Reading**: Ability to read CSV files from the filesystem
2. **Data Parsing**: Convert CSV rows into Order objects
3. **Validation**: Ensure data conforms to expected format and constraints
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed or incorrect CSV data

## Anticipated Interface

The component is expected to provide the following functionality:

```cpp
// Parse a CSV file and return a vector of Order objects
std::vector<Order> parseOrdersFromCSV(const std::string& filePath);

// Parse a CSV string and return a vector of Order objects
std::vector<Order> parseOrdersFromString(const std::string& csvContent);

// Validate whether a CSV file contains valid order data
bool validateCSV(const std::string& filePath);
```

## Relationship with Other Components
The CSV Parser is expected to work closely with the Order structure and OrderBook class:
- It converts raw CSV data into properly formatted Order objects
- These Order objects can then be processed by the OrderBook

## Future Implementation Notes
The implementation should consider:
1. **Performance**: Efficient parsing for large datasets
2. **Flexibility**: Ability to handle various CSV formats and delimiters
3. **Memory Management**: Streaming approach for very large files
4. **Error Reporting**: Clear reporting of parsing errors with line numbers and descriptions
